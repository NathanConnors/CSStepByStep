# CSStepByStep
For learning and review, all programs created using "Step By Step Microsoft Visual C# 2013" written by John Sharp

This Repository is purely me using a book from school to practice my Git abilities while reviewing some C# before the job search grind. I am actually not aware if this considered bad to do on GitHub but please if it is please let me know.

Thank you.
